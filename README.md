# Tune In Later

ListenLater is an audiobooks streaming site. When a visitor arrives, there are several genres available to browse. When a book is clicked, a description pops up. A search bar is available to search books by title, genre, or author. In order for the user to do anything beyond browsing at descriptions of the audiobooks available, the visitor must login. Once the user has signed in or has created an account, books are available to add to a collection of favorites by clicking the star on the cover. The user can come back to their collection any time the user is logged in.
